//TODO: This question is optional. It's bonus if you don't search or copy anything from the internet.

//Question 6: EA's and Google's Interview question

//You work in a 100 floor building and you get 2 identical eggs. 
//You need to figure out the highest floor an egg can be dropped without breaking. 
//Find an algorithm that is minimizing number of throws in the worst-case scenario.
//Code is not necessary. You can explain with your own words.
//You can make some assumptions like:
//1)If an egg doesn�t break when dropped from some floor, then it will not break when dropped from any lower floors.
//2)An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
//3)A broken egg must be discarded.
//4)The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
//5)If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.

//Answer:
//If we only had one egg, we would have to slowly work our way up from the bottom floor to the top.
//When that egg breaks, we've found the target floor we are looking for.
//This process is slow and can be made much quicker by using the second egg in riskier situations.
//When that egg breaks, we know that the the target floor is between the first and last attempt.
//Let's quickly name the eggs:
//Egg A is our risktaker egg and Egg B is the egg we use to slowly make our way up when Egg A breaks.
//Egg A will be dropped every 10 floors. When it breaks, we will use Egg A to narrow our search
//and explore the previous 9 floors from the bottom up.
//With this algorithm, the worst case scenerio would take 19 attemps, assuming that it breaks at floor 99:
//(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 Break A, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 Break B).
//This algorithm can be further optimized if we instead drop Egg A every (16 - n attempts) floors.
//In this version, the worst case is always 16 attempts:
//(16, 31, 45, 58, 70, 81, 91, 100 Break A, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 Break B)

{
    //Test:
    const int number = 3;
    const int order = 3;

    //EXPECTED RESULT: [1, 3, 9, 27]
